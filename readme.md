# Sample Store



## Description
This is a sample e-commerce store that I created. Customers can sign up for accounts, add products to their cart, checkout, view order history, and leave reviews.

## Technologies Used

The technologies used in creating this app are: 

- AngularJs
- Node.js
- Express
- JavaScript
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Heroku
- Token Auth
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap
- Materialize

## Getting Started

Click on the Heroku link below to go to the web store. Guest users can freely browse, view products, and add to the cart. But in order to checkout, users must register an account. Registered users can also check their order history and cancel any order they want.
